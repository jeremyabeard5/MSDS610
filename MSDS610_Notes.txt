		HW:
			docker run -it --rm --name hadoop1 -v /home/jeremy/Documents/GitStuff/Regis/simple_Hadoop_MapReduce_example:/hadoop_map_reduce:Z 3b127e41e697 /bin/sh
				this maps the local drive to /hadoop_map_reduce
				
			docker run -it --rm --name hadoop1 -v /home/jeremy/Documents/GitStuff/Regis/simple_Hadoop_MapReduce_example:/hadoop:Z 3b127e41e697
				actually, i guess the /bin/sh affected things
