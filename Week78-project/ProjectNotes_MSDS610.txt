Inverted Index

Project purpose is vague, some struggle may be required, that is intentional

Inverted Index Project
	Word doc
	Has all code, but written in java
	
spark-wordcount.ipynb example
	lets you work with spark, spark commands
	
Putting 2 examples above toggether can help you create inverted indexc in pyspark

Will need to have completed Lab 5 (anaconda installed) in order to do project

Dataset: will be stack overflow data


VIDEO 2
	Looking at stack overflow for thje project data
	Will be getting the stack overflow data from stackexchange
		go to https://data.stackexchange.com
			Compose Query
			Need to create an inverted index listing all the Post IDs where each tag appears
			Shows database Scheme
				
			My query will need Post IDs and tags and maybe filtering on creationdate
			Then click on Download csv
			Then load csv into jupyter notebooks and use pyspark commands to load it into HDFS
			then start to relate the wikipedia inverted index example to creating it using pyspark
			also look at the pyspark wordcount example
